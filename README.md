# Survival_Analysis__In_R

In practice, we will typically look for earthquake patterns. The time between two or more earthquakes is an example of time-to-event data that is examined using a statistical method known as survival analysis. This paper's main goal is to estimate how severely certain regions of the planet have been affected by a series of earthquakes. The indicator of censorship is the interval between two or more subsequent earthquakes. The data are frequently fitted to a survival model, like Kaplan Meier Estimation or the Hazard curve, depending on the discrepancy between the earthquake's timing of occurrence and its intensity. This will spread knowledge about earthquakes in certain regions where they commonly happen. This has been proved supported by application to real data “Earthquake Shaking Intensity Data Analysis”.
